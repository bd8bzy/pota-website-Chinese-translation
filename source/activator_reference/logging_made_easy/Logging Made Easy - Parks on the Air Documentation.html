                        </svg></a> Why is logging for Parks on the Air so complicated? </h1>
                <p>That is a question often asked by both veteran and new amateur operators upon joining the program.
                    They are accustomed to just entering a call into a computer / web based logging application and
                    that’s it – the computer does the rest.</p>
                <p>Well, the answer is: It isn’t complicated at all. There are some very easy to follow parameters
                    (Rules if you like that word) that are in place to make sure every log entered goes the right way
                    and both activators and hunters get the award credits due them.</p>
                <p>Yes, it is an award driven program in a way so to ensure the integrity of the program certain simple
                    rules are in place, easily found on the website, docs.pota.app. But this is about logging only so
                    let’s go….</p>
                <p>POTA has a log sorting system that uses the common “Amateur Data Interchange Format” (ADIF) file type
                    which is used to exchange information between logging programs and log databases such as QRZ, eQSL,
                    LoTW etc. It is globally uniform and simple.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of continuity, POTA uses this format so any logging program an activator may use will
                    be compatible with our system.</p>

                        </svg></a> How does an ADIF log work? </h1>
                <p>Imagine a spreadsheet such as that used in software like Excel or the like; there are columns and
                    rows.</p>
                <p>In an ADIF file the columns are called Fields and the Rows are where the data goes. Software that
                    reads ADIF files is designed to look for particular fields, labeled in the top row (header) of each
                    column, then it extracts the information from those fields to essentially read the log and sort the
                    information accordingly.</p>
                <p>The result is what you see in your activator or hunter logs as well as your activity stats and award
                    allocations.</p>

                        </svg></a> What is required in a POTA Log? </h1>
                <p>POTA has just Five required data fields that Must be in your log for it to be accepted and Five
                    secondary fields for particular situations. The fields are labeled with “Tags” as they’re called.
                </p>
                <p>The five required fields are: <strong>CALL</strong> (callsign you receive) <strong>QSO_DATE</strong>,
                    <strong>TIME_ON</strong>, <strong>MODE</strong> and <strong>BAND</strong>. These are
                    self-explanatory. No other fields are needed but may be in it without harm.</p>
                <p>For a simple activation by one operator in a single park this set is enough to get your log processed
                    without issue. You still only need these five data sets, just remember to change the date and put
                    the correct UTC time when logging or transcribing from paper!</p>

                        </svg></a> What are the other fields for? </h1>
                <p>The first set of “optional” fields come into play if you get a call of Park to Park (P2P). Many will
                    tell you that they aren’t needed, the system catches them automatically, and in essence it Should
                    but, it doesn’t Always so these fields are insurance in a way, making sure the cross reference is
                    applied. Remember, insurance never hurts to have.</p>
                <p>These fields are <strong>MY_SIG_INFO</strong> and <strong>SIG_INFO</strong>. “SIG” meaning Special
                    Interest Group. Your park ID: Location appropriate letter(s) (K, JA, VK, PA), a dash (-) and 4
                    number set, is put in MY_SIG_INFO. This field is the same for Every contact whether a P2P or not. If
                    you have no P2Ps, it is ignored but, when you get that call of “park to park” in your radio, you
                    will put the “other” operator’s park in the field labeled SIG_INFO and together these two fields
                    ensure your P2P is credited (as long as the other operator sends in a properly formatted log of
                    course).</p>
                <p>NOTE: If you receive a 2fer or 3fer P2P from the Other activator, just make additional entries in
                    your log But, make sure to put the correct park numbers in the SIG_INFO field so the entries do not
                    dupe.</p>
                <p>All data can be identical, Including Time, except the park numbers. That is what will present them as
                    unique entries to our parsing system.</p>

                <p>The remaining pair of fields are not commonly used and often forgotten. They are
                    <strong>STATION_CALLSIGN</strong> and <strong>OPERATOR</strong>. These are used when there are two
                    or more calls associated with an activation.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>The We Love Radio Club of Galifray activates a POTA entity for its anniversary using the club call,
                    W1WHO, as the on air callsign. Club member N1ABC is at the mic / key. Both the club and the operator
                    are registered with individual POTA accounts.</p>
                <p>Since the club call is the one given on air to incoming calls / hunters, it is put in the field
                    STATION_CALLSIGN and N1ABC is put in OPERATOR. These fields are carried through with each entry by
                    your logging application when put in during the initial setup for that park’s specific log.</p>
                <p>When submitted and processed, the club and the operator get credit for the activation, but hunters
                    get credit for the actual contact with the club call only, since it was a single contact. If the
                    operator Also gives his / her call, then a separate log must be submitted for each call.</p>
                <p>If operators are changed during the activation the OPERATOR field must be updated with the different
                    call when the change occurs..</p>

                <p>If you activate a park that is in more than one state / province / territory, you should include the
                    specific location in the file field labeled <strong>MY_STATE</strong>. This will allow our parsing
                    algorithms to assign the credits properly for hunters WAS awards and activators trying to build
                    their Activated States matrix there are many parks, historic trails and rivers that span multiple
                    locations in all countries, so it is Your Job to know where you were and put it in the filename. If
                    you Do Not include the <strong>MY_STATE</strong> field you’ll have to choose it manually when
                    uploading your file(s).</p>
                <p>The <strong>MY_STATE</strong> field will be parsed for any location whether a US State, Canadian
                    Province, Australian Territory or Russian Oblast.</p>

                        </svg></a> What if we’re operating a Special Event Station (SES) from a Park? </h1>
                <p>For SES calls, if it will be used by a Single Operator, that operator creates a secondary account
                    under their own account, properly date limited with particular start – stop for that event. (If
                    using a short 1x1 call, remember that those can be recycled many times so putting the specific
                    beginning and ending dates are important for proper credit distribution) That SES Call is put in the
                    log file field labeled Station_Callsign with the single operator’s call in the Operator field.
                    Hunters will get the park / points from Only the SES call, which is what is given Over the Air,
                    while the operator gets the activation and any award specific to the activation Only.</p>
                <p>If the SES activity will have a conglomerate of operators then it must be added to a Club account, so
                    All operators get their activation credit. Registered Clubs log files are parsed differently than
                    personal accounts, which won’t recognize the Other calls in the Operator field and will be rejected
                    as the other operators are not associated with the personal account.</p>

                        </svg></a> Spotting an SES with multiple operators </h1>
                <p>When many are spotting the same call on our spotting page there must be a /X (a unique identifier)
                    appended after the call to not have one spot bump the previous, even if different bands / modes are
                    used. Only the SES call is given on the air though, without the /x identifier. I suggest using the
                    band after the / such as K3Y/40 for 40 meters as an example.</p>
                <p>Some folks will log it with the /X in their personal log but it only matters if they expect
                    confirmations Outside of POTA. The important thing would be to make sure to tell any P2Ps to log
                    ONLY the SES call, sans the /x, and You do the same in the event log. Hunters wil get the park
                    regardless of They log the contact.</p>

                        </svg></a> How do I log a multi-park activation properly, so all credits are given? </h1>
                <p>This situation is commonly referred to as 2fers, 3fers etc.. and logging is very simple for these.
                    Create one initial log for Any of the park numbers you’re activating, it makes no difference which –
                    just make sure it is identified in the <strong>MY_SIG_INFO</strong> field when initiating the log so
                    it carries over to each entry. Of course, any P2Ps during this activation go in the
                    <strong>SIG_INFO</strong> field as usual.</p>
                <p><strong>DO NOT USE</strong> Any other field names! We’ve seen some folks create their own field
                    labels for P2P entries and then hammer our help desk asking Why they aren’t seeing the matches. The
                    ONLY fields recognized for a P2P match are those described above.</p>
                <p>When complete, open the log in any text editing software – I use Notepad in Windows or ADIF Master
                    which is an application for reading and editing ADIF files. Find the <strong>MY_SIG_INFO</strong>
                    field if using ADIF Master and select all cells in the column. Right click in one of the selected
                    cells and choose Replace in Selection. It should show the park number in the find box, and you put
                    the second (and third if needed in a sequential edit) park number in the “Replace With” box, apply
                    the changes and click FILE &gt; “Save As” and rename the file with the new park number (presuming
                    you saved and correctly named the initial log).</p>
                <p>In Notepad, which is on every Windows based computer, open the file, then EDIT &gt; Replace, put the
                    initial park number in the Find What box, put the other park(s) in the Replace With box and click
                    Replace All. Close that dialog window and again, FILE &gt; Save As, changing the park number in the
                    filename accordingly. For MAC / Apple users, the equivalent application is called simply “TextEdit”
                </p>
                <p>NOTE: Always make sure there is a DASH (-) between the location identifier and the numbers in the
                    Park ID.</p>
                <p>If you forget and just have for example <strong>K1234</strong>, the file will be rejected. This goes
                    for Your park and the P2P parks as described above.</p>

                        </svg></a> Do I need to make separate files if I use different modes? </h1>
                <p>Absolutely not. Whether you operated with all SSB or a mix of SSB, CW, AM, FT4/8, Satellite and PSK31
                    (or Any mode you like) you only make One file for a given park. If you mix modes during an
                    activation and use WSJT-X, just import those entries into your adi file before uploading.</p>
                <p>As long as you enter the data accordingly for each mode, our system will sort it out during
                    processing – we’re That good!</p>

                <p>Before we launched the Self-Uploader feature we had just 10 area coordinators processing All logs;
                    not just from US operators but from around the globe.</p>
                <p>During that time having a standardized file naming system made tracking logs for any future repairs
                    easier. I personally saved every log I ever processed and if an activator said they did not get what
                    they expected once the log was in, I could easily find what they’d sent and look for any problems.

                <p>Now, to the naming issue: In preparing for self-uploading a standard had to be agreed upon for the
                    developers to work with thus, a standard filename format was mandated to get everyone ready for when
                    self-uploading was released.</p>
                <p>The standard is as such –</p>
                <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <pre class="highlight"><code>callsign@park#-yyyymmdd
</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>An example using one of my own activations would look like this:</p>
                <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <pre class="highlight"><code>KB2FMH@K-8088-20220202.adi
</code></pre>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>which was an activation at park K-8088 on February 2nd , 2022. Maintaining a uniform naming system
                    will help You now.</p>

                <p>If you find you need a log replaced due to an error of any kind, you Must ask either the Help Desk
                    Or, you area coordinator. Users cannot Delete logs – only upload.</p>
                <p>In the event of a log file error just click the Down Arrow next to the file on your “My Uploaded
                    Logs” portal and click Request Help. Include the park ID and date of the file you’d like removed and
                    one of our support staff will reply when it is done, allowing You to upload a new replacement log.
                </p>
                <p>If the file presents errors during upload that you cannot figure out, again, click the Request Help
                    button and we’re on our way to resolve the issue!</p>
                <p>Lastly, there are may different logging programs out there that put many different fields in a log
                    file.</p>
                <p>Fields such as Frequency, Name, Grid / Locator, County etc.. are Not required for our system so do
                    not waste time worrying about this data.</p>
                <p>Of course, you can always ask your area coordinator for help if you feel more comfortable.</p>
